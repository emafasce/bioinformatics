FUNDAMENTAL TASK

- Segmentation with networks: which model performs better?
From a preliminary study, the most premising networks a part from Unet are Ma-Net (built for tumor segmentation) and Linknet (build for scene semantic segmentation). Probably these three models will be studied more accurately, also performing sweeps.

QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE

- Do bigger images ensure bigger accuracy? - It seems no, but more accurate experiments should be performed.
- Are any transformations useful? - Implemented
- Can I train a network from scratch and obtain the same results? - A bit lower.
