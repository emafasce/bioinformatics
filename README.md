# Segmentation and classification on human renal tissue

This is the Bioinformatics project "Segmentation and classification on human renal tissue". In this github folder you can find the Latex document (Bioinformatics_report.pdf), the presentation (Slides.pdf) and all the code I wrote. The slides are also available at this link: https://www.canva.com/design/DAEyXnS4_mo/saVemvrUL28bs4x03GMadA/view?utm_content=DAEyXnS4_mo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink
In this Readme I provide a brief explanation on how to run the code.

### MAIN TASKS

- Segmentation of cancerous images
- Classification on the type of cancer using the predictions of the best performing segmentation network as inputs


### FILES DESCRIPTION

Notebooks for the training: they are all contained in training_nbs folder. To run them, make a Wandb account (1) and change the path for the home folder.

Notebooks for the visualizations: they are all contained in visualizations folder.

Notebooks for the dataset: they are all contained in dataset folder.

The Predictions folder contains the segmentation predictions of the best performing model.


### APPENDIX

(1): In this project I used Wandb to log the results.
